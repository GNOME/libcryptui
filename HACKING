If you want to hack on seahorse, please ask on seahorse-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.
Patches are preferred, and should be submitted on bugzilla.gnome.org if possible.

For a todo list, first check bugzilla, then look at TODO.
I try to keep bugzilla updated with possibly enhancements and any current bugs
since TODO is not updated as often as it should be.

Translators are welcome to update translations, but committing
to head is not recommended atm because it is not string stable.

For those looking over the code, I realize some parts may not be very readable.
I am happy to explain any confusing parts and add comments where they are missing,
just ask on seahorse-devel.

Here is a description of the modules:

* bonobo: Bonobo servers. Currently there is the only the Nautilus Context Menu server.
Future servers will be a SeahorseContext Factory to serve out-of-process contexts and nautilus properties pages.
The rationale for the context factory is that only for specific operations is a new context needed.
For everything else, using the same context allows signals to be emitted for all processes,
and any new keys will be added in one process will be added in any others.
The properties pages will be at least gpg files, which may include signature verification,
and possibly a key-properties page for the keys:/// uri.

* data: Data files that need to be processed. Current this is schemas and desktop files.
They are here because there will be multiple schemas files (app, pgp) and multiple desktop files (app, capplet).

* libseahorse: Common library code for seahorse. This should not depend on other code modules (read: not data),
and other code modules should only depend on this (or bonobo servers).
Any code that is depended on by multiple modules, such as src/ and plugins/nautilus,
is placed here. Currently this includes SeahorseContext & keys, operations,
and common dialogs.

* plugins: Contains subdirs for any possible apps in which seahorse can provide a plugin.
Currently this includes nautilus. Gedit will be the next plugin target.
Future possibilities are AbiWord and Gaim.

* plugins/nautilus: This doesn't really contain nautilus targetted code,
but nautilus/file-manager oriented code that doesn't go anywhere else.
Currently this is just a control center capplet and mime data.
Future plans are to add a keys:/// uri for browsing public keys
Bonobo stuff, such as property pages, should go in the bonobo module.

* plugins/gedit: Empty atm, will eventually contain a gedit plugin for doing text ops.
This will also require adding a check to configure.in for gedit-2.4.

* src: The main app code. This currently includes the main window & dialogs,
along with code that hasn't been deemed necessary to include in libseahorse.


Roadmap:
As of 4/28/03, the main goal atm is to stabilize head for a 0.7.3 release.
After that, my next goal is to do the context factory & updated appropriately.
Next is property pages, keys:///, drag-n-drop, and gedit plugin, not necessarily in that order.
For the 0.8.0 release, I want seahorse to be as integrated into GNOME and
as GNOMEish as possible. This will include ui/hig and a11y reviews.
If a new stable gnupg is released before 0.8 that supports total ordering of uids,
then operations on the user ids will be added.
