Seahorse is a gnome2 interface for gnupg.
It uses gpgme as the backend.

The goal of the Seahorse app is to be a powerful tool for key management and encryption functionality.
The goal of the Seahorse Project is to provide useful, easy to use encryption software for the gnome desktop.
Other than the Seahorse app, this includes plugins for gedit, pluggable bonobo components, desktop integration, nautilus scripts, and mail client integration.
