Future Features
---------------

[ ] Gedit plugin

[ ] Bonoboize
[ ] Visual trust diagram
[ ] Complete usage & concept manual
[ ] Balsa plugin
[ ] Gaim plugin
[ ] Some kind of component that can be detected at runtime that apps could use
to encrypt files or text.  Maybe this would be an applet, or something similar
to a viewer, but in actuality a Saver/Converter (?).

Non-tasked issues/todo
----------------------

1. Register with gnome-vfs so can do file ops in nautilus, similar to file-roller.
However, due to the use of seahorse's preferences, a control-center capplet (is this the correct word?)
should be provided.
	*: Import, Encrypt, Sign
	.asc: Decrypt, Verify
	.gpg: Decrypt
	.sig: Verify
	no file: Export
2. Changing a key's owner trust may affect the validity of any keys it has signed.
Since keys are cached, the signed key's validity may not be correct until it has been updated.
The context could do a second pass through the keys so that each key will listen
to changes to those keys that have signed it.
3. Register a keys:/// uri, which could allow editing from within nautilus.
Keys would be listed with photos as icons.  If no photo, then do secret icon
or non-secret icon.
