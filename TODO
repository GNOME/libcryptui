Non-tasked issues/todo
----------------------

1. Changing a key's owner trust may affect the validity of any keys it has signed.
Since keys are cached, the signed key's validity may not be correct until it has been updated.
The context could do a second pass through the keys so that each key will listen
to changes to those keys that have signed it.
