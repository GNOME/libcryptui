Non-tasked issues/todo
----------------------

1. Changing a key's owner trust may affect the validity of any keys it has signed.
Since keys are cached, the signed key's validity may not be correct until it has been updated.
The context could do a second pass through the keys so that each key will listen
to changes to those keys that have signed it. An easy way out would be to inform
the user that validity of any signed keys may not be correct until seahorse is restarted.
However, if contexts are served, that would require killing all running seahorse related processes,
which is less than ideal. A better way would be having an option to refresh the key lists,
if doing key->key signalling is not feasible.
